# Unduck

The fastest "search engine" for !bang users 💥.

When the search engine was created by [Theo Browne](https://github.com/t3dotgg), I was looking for a way to not just search using my browser directly, but to make it most widely available on my system, using the power of Raycast.

## Features

- 🔍 Search anything, everywhere, using thousands of available bangs.
- 💾 Save searches to a list of saved searches.
- 💾 Customize the default bang to use if none is specified in the query.
- 💾 Customize whether or not to save searches to a list of saved searches.
- 📝 Add autocomplete suggestions for available bangs.
- 📝 And many other cool features coming soon!
- 💬 Credit to [Theo Browne](https://github.com/t3dotgg) for the original idea.
